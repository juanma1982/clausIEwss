# ClausIE (with split paragraph into sentences)

ClausIE is a Open Information Extraction. It allows to extract semantic relations from texts in english.
You can find more information here: https://scholar.google.com.ar/scholar?hl=es&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=ClausIE+Del+Corro&btnG=
ClausIE process texts like this: "Albert Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Sweden in 1921." and returns tuples like:
	 		("Albert Einstein", "was awarded", "the Nobel Prize")
			("Albert Einstein", "was awarded", "in Sweden")
			("Albert Einstein", "was awarded", "in 1921")

This version has a modification made by me (https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VSRKO3EAAAAJ&hl=es).
This modification allows ClausIE to split each input text into independent sentences.
The modification was presented in the following article: https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3184099
